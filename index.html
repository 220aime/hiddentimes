    <h2>About Us!</h2>
    <p>
      HiddenTimes focuses on entertainment and calture, howeverThere is a close relationship between culture and entertainment. Many entertaining activities have established community culture. For example, festivals are essential for building community culture while providing fun and entertainment. Culture is a word that is used to describe the ‘way of life for a group of people or how they live their life or act socially. For example, you may meet with your friends and watch movies or play games on weekends. Most people within your community may perform similar tasks. These kinds of activities can build community and establish a culture.

    <h2>Target and Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to corporate entertainment, I see the same old ideas and approaches. Much of what you read is just common sense.  Hire that band, bring in that photo booth, add that magician, or make it a casino night. Let’s step back a minute. Everything in a corporate event should have an objective. There should be a reason and a budget behind activities that takes place at corporate functions, including entertainment. If we understand the purpose of the corporate entertainment it makes it much easier to select the appropriate entertainment that serves that purpose. There are a lot of different reasons for entertainment depending on the occasion, setting and motivation behind the function.

    <h2>What We do & Our Audiance</h2>
    <p>
     As life gets increasingly busy, it becomes more difficult for people to spend time with their loved ones. Thus, it is necessary to keep everyone entertained to ensure a relaxing time when a family break does become feasible. Entertainment provides a way to break away from everyday humdrum activity and enjoy a refreshing moment together.
    Ente rtainment brings happiness, which is a fundamental and powerful medicine that aids health and wellbeing. It is said “when you are happy, you have everything.” Happiness can even reduce stress and tension. Movies, music and TV series can all create joy in people’s lives. When watching or listening, members of the audience tend to forget the snags, miseries, worries and difficulties of their own lives.
